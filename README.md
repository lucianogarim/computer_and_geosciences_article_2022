# General instructions:

The methodology scripts can be executed in Matlab, version 2020b or higher. The "Main.m" code can be run without any modification, with the default parameters.

In the section "Initial parameters", the user can modify the initial wave parameters, such as height and direction.

In the section " Genetic algorithm hyperparameters", it is possible to modify the hyperparameters of the genetic algorithm, such as population size, number of generations, among others.

Depth and paleobathymetry intervals can be modified directly in the .fis files.

For testing, paleobathymetry and seismic facies surfaces are provided. The user can change them if he wants, however it is necessary to verify that the age of the surfaces is the same.

When running the scripts make sure that all data is in the Matlab directory.
